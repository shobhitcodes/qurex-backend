pleasure. Males usually ejaculate (cum) upon
reaching orgasm and females experience vaginal
wall contractions.Some females may also ejaculate
while experiencing an orgasm. During orgasm there
is intense feeling of pleasure not only in the genitals
but also throughout the body.It is accompanied by a
series of physical sensations like involuntary release
of muscle tension, muscular contractions (the
muscles in the vagina or penis or anus contract
about once per 5-8 times), verbal and auditory
emission of pleasure, increased heart and breathing
rate so on and so forth. Just after an orgasm, the
clitoris or the head of the penis (glans of the penis)
may feel very sensitive or uncomfortable to touch.
The individual may have ?sex flush?wherein the
colour of the chest, neck and face changes for a
short duration.There is also release of endorphins (
feel-good hormones) because of which an individual
feels relaxed, happy and sleepy",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null
